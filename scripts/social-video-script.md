## Caption Templates

**Engaging:**
"Still updating Salesforce by hand after appointments? That's 16 hours a month you're not getting back. There's a better way. 👇"

**Pain Point:**
"Nobody became a real estate AE because they love data entry. So why are you spending hours on it every week?"

**Results-Focused:**
"One of our AEs went from 15-minute post-appointment updates to 2-minute voice debriefs. Same data. Same accuracy. 87% less time."

**Curiosity:**
"What if your CRM actually understood 'seller's going through a divorce and needs to move fast' without you having to find the right dropdown menu?"
